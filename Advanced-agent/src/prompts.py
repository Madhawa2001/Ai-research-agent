    Your task is to extract a list of **tools, libraries, SDKs, platforms, or services** specifically relevant to the query: "{query}".

    Rules:
    - Only include actual, named developer tools (e.g., SDKs, libraries, platforms).
    - Do NOT include general terms (e.g., "database", "backend").
    - Prefer tools built **for** or commonly **used with** {query}.
    - Include both open source and commercial tools.
    - Do NOT include tools that are unrelated or only indirectly connected to {query}.
    - Return a list of max 5 relevant tools â€” each on a separate line, no descriptions.

Focus on extracting information relevant to programmers and software developers.

You must return a **valid Python dictionary** in the exact format below. 
Strictly follow these rules:
- Boolean fields (like `api_available` and `is_open_source`) must be **true, false, or null** (unquoted).
- List fields (like `tech_stack`, `language_support`, and `integration_capabilities`) must be **actual lists**, not strings.
- Do not wrap booleans or lists in strings. Do not return any extra text outside the dictionary.

Example format:

  "pricing_model": "Freemium",
  "is_open_source": true,
  "tech_stack": ["NoSQL", "Realtime DB", "Cloud Functions"],
  "description": "Firebase provides cloud services and APIs for mobile and web developers.",
  "api_available": true,
  "language_support": ["JavaScript", "Dart"],
  "integration_capabilities": ["GitHub", "Google Cloud"]
